## If Winemakers Could Predict the Future...

- Wine ratings are the standard in grading wine quality.

- Better ratings = Higher sales

- How can winemakers predict how their wines will be rated?

- The Wine Quality Predictor App can predict expert ratings based on a wine's physiochemical properties!

## An Example Wine (Rated 7/10)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
source("helpers.R")
example <- data.frame(training[11,c(1,3,5,6,7,11,12,13)], row.names = NULL)
appPrediction <- data.frame(appPrediction = predict(fitSVM, example))
```
```{r}
example
appPrediction
```

## Another Example Wine (Rated 5/10)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
example <- data.frame(training[75,c(1,3,5,6,7,11,12,13)], row.names = NULL)
appPrediction <- data.frame(appPrediction = predict(fitSVM, example))
```
```{r}
example
appPrediction
```

## Why Winemakers Need This

* Fine wine sales will [grow 14-18%][link1]

* Fine wine is projected to sell for over $20 a bottle

* Attaching a wineâ€™s score to its price tag results in [increased sales by 25%][link2]

* High-scoring wines display a higher increase in sales compared to low-scoring wines

* [Shortages in wine grapes][link3] makes creating the right wine more critical
